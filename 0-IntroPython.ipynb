    "# Creating Variables\n",
    "One of the fundamentals of programming is declaring variables.  Variables have a \"type\", such as integer numbers, floating point numbers, or strings, and any programming language will treat different variable types differently.  Python makes it easy on us and tries to interpret what we mean. However, we have to be smarter than our programming language!\n",
    "\n",
    "The first data type is an _integer_.  An integer is any positive or negative whole number (no decimal places).  In computer science, any arithmetic operation with two integers will create another integer.  For instance, in integer math, $5\\div2=2$.  This operation takes the decimal result of $2.5$ and truncates (it does _not_ round) to the nearest whole number.  Similarly, $5\\div-3=-1$ even though any calculator will give you the result of $-1.667$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second data type you should know is a _float_.  This is any number that has a decimal, such as $1.0$, $-362.278$, or $9.4\\textrm{e}9$ (9.4 billion). Floats work exactly the way you would expect in normal arithmetic.\n",
    "It is important to note that Python 3 (which we are using) treats integers as floats for division using `/`, so the above doesn't apply. Integer division uses `//` in Python 3. \n",
